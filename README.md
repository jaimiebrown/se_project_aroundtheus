# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images
- Project Link

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Resolutions at 1280px and 320px are detailed in the Figma project linked below, but all additional resolutions are modified using best practices for style and preventing a horizontal scrollbar. In addition, this is the first exposure to using grid elements in the code and determining when to use grid vs. flexbox. Finally, with elements displayed on varying screen sizes, this is the first introduction to using media queries to account for different resolutions.
