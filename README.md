**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Resolutions at 1280px and 320px are detailed in the Figma project linked below, but all additional resolutions are modified using best practices for style and preventing a horizontal scrollbar.

This project uses grid elements in the code as part of a determination to use grid or flexbox in specific areas.

This is the first introduction to using media queries to account for different resolutions.

The project introduced using Javascript to add functionality to all designed buttons including editing the profile, adding a new card, deleting a card, or liking a card. Smooth transitions were added to the opening and closing of the modals as a design feature.
